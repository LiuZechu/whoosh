# whoosh
*whoosh* is a virtual queueing app for restaurants. *whoosh* takes a group of diners into a queue upon their arrival, and maintains a digital representation of the queue. Diners enter the queue by scanning a unique QR code for the restaurant. Diners can then view the queue in real time and are notified when they should enter. Restaurant managers can manage the waitlist, alerting and removing queuers as necessary.

Restaurants are able to sign up with *whoosh* to create virtual queues for their restaurants, and diners will
scan a QR code to enter this queues. Restaurant managers can then virtually manage the queue.

## Accessing the web app
